# Sales Prediction for Future Months Project

This repository contains code and "invented data" for a successful sales prediction project. The project aims to predict total sales for future months using historical sales data and various machine learning models. It also includes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization of sales trends.

## Introduction

In this project, we use historical sales data to predict total sales for future months. The dataset includes various features such as lead time, order cost, unit cost, sales price, current inventory, demand rate, quantity sold, and total sales. We preprocess the data, encode categorical features, and split it into training and testing sets.

Three machine learning models are trained and evaluated: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. The best model is chosen based on mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared (R^2) metrics.

## Data

The sales data is stored in a CSV file, which is read using the `pandas` library. The dataset includes the following columns:

- `year`: Year of the sales data.
- `month`: Month of the sales data.
- `product_type`: Type of the product.
- `location`: Location where the sales occurred.
- `lead_time`: Lead time for the product.
- `order_cost`: Cost of ordering the product.
- `unit_cost`: Unit cost of the product.
- `sales_price`: Sales price of the product.
- `current_inventory`: Current inventory level.
- `demand_rate`: Demand rate for the product.
- `quantity_sold`: Quantity sold in a particular month.
- `total_sales`: Total sales for a particular month.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `sales_data.csv`: CSV file containing the sales data.
- `sales_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation code.
- `README.md`: This README file providing project information and usage instructions.
- `images/`: Directory containing images.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sales-prediction.git
cd sales-prediction
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `sales_prediction.ipynb` to view the code and execute it step-by-step.

3. The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization code.

4. You can also modify the notebook to use different models, perform hyperparameter tuning, or explore additional visualizations.

## Results

The project provides insights into future sales predictions using different machine learning models. The best-performing model is the **Random Forest Regressor**, which achieves low MSE and MAE, as well as a high R^2 value. The model is used to predict total sales for the months 7 to 12 of the year 2023.

The project also includes visualizations to help understand sales trends, demand rates, and product performance over time.
